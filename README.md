# IGME-235
The Github repository for IGME-235 where all classwork will be.

Well since the Hello World tutorial is asking for a description of the student... hi my name's Matt! I love video games (wowee who could have guessed consdering my major) and I want to learn how to cook because food is good. I also enjoy playing the piano in my spare time, mainly video game music (if only more people played it instead of the "classics"...). I'm also praying that the world stops burning from this pandemic so I can hopefully study abroad next fall! I'm a pretty chill guy who loves meeting new people, so if you're a good person to me we're cool. :)
